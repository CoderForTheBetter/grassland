This is a little mod I made for this forum topic: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=18360
You can use any mapgen and this mode will clear all the trees, flowers, and biomes. Ores and caves will still be on. You can disable the ores if you like in the mapgen.lua file (I already have it commented out, so just uncomment that line). There may be ways to disable caves, but I'm not sure.

Enjoy!
